            <h4>Summary of Study - Week 6</h4>
            <p>This <q>ToDo</q> project was a challenge.  I was not able to get everything working.  I was trying to keep my code nice and neat by organizing it in the MVC format, but it ended up getting messy anyway.</p>
            <p>I need to spend some more time on it so that I can get the remaining functionality going.  After that, I need to go through it and organize it better.  I spent a lot of time on it, but it felt like I was spinning my wheels a lot.</p>
            <p>Good news...I've learning A LOT during this process!  Even though my project isn't "totally awesome status", the amount of stuff I've learned is.</p>
