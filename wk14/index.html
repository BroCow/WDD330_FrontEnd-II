            <p>
                I have a lot to learn still, so I'm going to keep practicing by building 
                small and simple apps.  I'm also considering putting together a web-app for my wife who 
                makes/sells her own jewelry.  I think that project would use a lot of what I have been learning. 
            </p>
            <p>I have learned so much in this class. My confidence with JavaScript has grown in a huge way! At 
                the start of this class I wasn't even comfortable writing a simple function that would make something
                happen when a button is clicked. Now I look over the code I've written and can hardly believe I 
                wrote it! What's even more amazing is that I understand it.
            </p>
            <p>The structure of this class may have been hard for some, but it enabled me to attack the areas where I 
                needed to learn most. It also allowed me to learn in a way that worked best for me. I wish some of my
                other classes were structured like this one.
            </p>
