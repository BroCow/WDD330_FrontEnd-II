                    <p class="aboutMe_p">Hello, my name is Chris Cowan and I have always been intimidated by JavaScript. I don't come from a coding background, 
                        so my pursuit of a Web Design and Development degree is challenging. However, it has been AWESOME to learn this stuff and
                        I have a ton of ideas on how I can use these skills to bless others.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="aboutMe_p">
                        I'm not sure why JavaScript has been so hard for me to grasp compared to the other languages, but I'm thankful that this class
                        is going to help me drill into it and become more confident.  I'm also thankful for the structure which allows for learning in a 
                        way the works for me, since the best way I learn is to just play around with the code.  I think the exercises will be a great way
                        to do that.
                    </p>
