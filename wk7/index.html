            <h4>Summary of Study</h4>
            <p><strong>This was an exciting week for me! I attacked my portfolio and did some MAJOR refactoring!!!</strong></p>
            <p>Over the last few weeks I have learned a lot about how to work with JavaScript. This week I decided to take that knowledge
                and drill into my portfolio. The way I had my code organized was terrible.</p>
            <p>When I created my portfolio I tried using as much JS as possible, so instead of a typical navigation with links I created buttons
                that called a function that would redirect to the page. This was cool, but as the semester progressed I found issues:
                <ul>
                    <li>Each week I had to manually create another button in the HTML for every single page in the portfolio</li>
                    <li>Each button had it's own function to direct to the page, so I had a long list of functions that were almost identical</li>
                    <li>Only the home page referenced the main.js file - the week pages only referenced their own .js file. Because of this the
                        functions for the nav buttons had to be present in each week's .js file. So, every week I also had to update every single
                        .js file with the new function.  I had the same code copied into multiple files!
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Another feature I implemented that I thought was cool but created an issue was my content buttons. Each week has buttons that are
                used to show/hide the content for that week (i.e. Notes, Exercises, Questions). Very cool, but this had the same problem as the 
                nav buttons. I had to copy the functions for the buttons into every single week, which led to having the same code over and over in
                multiple files.
            </p>
            <p>To fix these issues, I wanted to develop some JS code that would accomplish three main goals:
                <ol>
                    <li>Dynamically create the nav buttons, including all associated attributes and text</li>
                    <li>Move all the <q>nav button</q> and <q>content button</q> code to the main.js file so it wouldn't be repeated</li>
                    <li>Create modules that the main.js file could use to simplify and organize the code</li>
                </ol>
                This was extremely challenging for me! Getting the nav buttons to be created across all the pages was especially difficult. There were
                multiple functions, arrays, and variables that needed to be created and work together in order for them to function properly.
                </p>

            <p><strong>BUT I DID IT!</strong></p>
            <p>Now, all I need to do is add a number to my <q>week number</q> array and <strong>BOOM!</strong> The new nav button is created
            on every single page in the portfolio along with all its attributes, text, and associated link. So awesome!</p>
            <p>I was also able to modularize my code and get both the nav and content buttons working the way I wanted. For me, this was a 
            significant accomplishment.  It took a long time, a lot of patience, digging into resources, and <strong>I have no idea how many console.logs()!!!</strong> 
            </p>
            <p>For this week, I'm hoping that this work I have done on my portfolio can be credited as my exercises. It took most of my time this week
                to accomplish this. I was still able to read the assigned chapters, but my notes are not as extensive as usual. I am looking forward 
                to learning more about AJAX though!
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for a great class. I'm learning so much and my confidence with JS has improved a lot. I still have a long way to go, but I at
                least feel like I'm moving and heading in the right direction!
            </p>

                <h4>Chapter Topics</h4>

                </ul>
                <h4>Function Properties and Methods</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>First-class functions - can have properties and methods</p>
                <h3>Call & Apply Methods</h3>
                <p>The call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an object that is provided as the first argument.</p>
                <p>In the console, enter the function descJS.call() and pass in one of the following terms to see a message about JS! <br>
                (See code in wk7.js)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>cool</li>
                    <li>hard</li>
                    <li>challenging</li>
                    <li>fun</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If the function that’s called requires any parameters, these need to be provided as arguments after the first argument, which is always the value of this.</p>
                <p>The apply() method works in the same way, except the arguments of the function are provided as an array, even if there is only one argument</p>
                <p>Call & Apply - allow generalized functions to be written that are not tied to specific objects by being methods of that object. This gives flexibility over how the functions can be used.</p>
                <p>Memoization - If a function takes some time to compute a return value, we can save the result in a cache property. Then if the same argument is used again later, we can return the value from the cache, rather than having to compute the result again.</p>

                <h4>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</h4>
                <p>Immediately Invoked Function Expression – or IIFE:  a useful way of performing a task while keeping any variables wrapped up within the scope of the function. This means the global namespace is not polluted with lots of variable names.</p>
                <h3>Initialization Code</h3>
                <p>Used to deliver welcome message - can be used with cookies for a personalized experience</p>
                <p>Good to use with <q>strict mode</q> if working with other's code so strict only applied to own code.</p>

                <h4>Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves</h4>
                <p>A function is able to not only call itself, but define itself, and even redefine itself. This is done by assigning an anonymous function to a variable that has the same name as the function.</p>
                <h5>Code Example:</h5>
                <p>function party(){ <br>
                    console.log('Wow this is amazing!');<br>
                    party = function(){<br>
                        console.log('Been there, got the T-Shirt');<br>
                    }<br>
                    }<br>
                     const beachParty = party; // note that the party function<br>
                    ➥ has not been invoked<br>
                    beachParty(); // the party() function has now been<br>
                    ➥ redefined, even though it hasn't been called explicitly -- 'Wow this is amazing!'<br>
                    party();<br>
                    -- 'Been there, got the T-Shirt'<br>
                    beachParty(); // but this function hasn't been redefined<br>
                    -- 'Wow this is amazing!'<br>
                    beachParty(); // no matter how many times this is called it ➥ will remain the same<br>
                    -- 'Wow this is amazing!'</p>
                <p>Losing Properties - Lazy Definition Pattern and is often used when some initialization code is required the first time it’s invoked. This means the initialization can be done the first time it’s called, then the function can be redefined to what you want it to be for every subsequent invocation.</p>
                <h3>Init-Time Branching</h3>
                <p>Write if-else function to check for functionality of a browser and execute appropriate code. After initialization code redefines itself.</p>
                
                <h4>Recursive Functions</h4>
                <p>Invokes itself until a certain condition is met.</p>
                <p>Instead of waiting for an event to occur, a callback can be created that’s invoked when the event happens. This means that the code is able to run out of order, or asynchronously.</p>
                <p>a callback always has to wait for the current execution stack to complete before it’s invoked.</p>
                <p>Avoid Callback Hell - don't use more than one callback in a single function</p>
                <p>Example of callback function in wk7.js</p>
                <h5>Promises</h5>
                <p>Promises - represents the future result of an asynchronous operation</p>
                <p>The Promise of a Burger Party3 is a brilliant post by Mariko Kosaka that explains the concept of promises by comparing them to ordering a burger!</p>
                <p>A promise is created using a constructor function</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>const promise = new Promise( (resolve, reject) =&gt { <br>
                    // initialization code goes here<br>
                    if (success) {<br>
                        resolve(value);<br>
                    } else {<br>
                        reject(error);<br>
                    }<br>
                });</p>
                <p>Once a promise has been settled, the then() method can be used to deal with the outcome. </p>

                <h4>Callbacks</h4>
                <p>Functions passed to other functions as arguments and then invoked inside the function they are passed to.</p>
